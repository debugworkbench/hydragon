# Hydragon Tests

## Overview

The current test harness is designed to support both unit and integration tests, the latter can
span across multiple processes. The main process runs a set of Mocha tests, some of which can
request that the renderer process runs some Mocha tests. Test progress is piped from the main
process to the renderer process where it is merged with the test progress of the renderer-side
tests and displayed in the DevTools console (hopefully the console reporter will be replaced by a
much nicer HTML reporter at some point in the future).

## Directory Layout

- `lib` - JavaScript files generated by the build process.
- `src`
  - `common` - process agnostic modules.
  - `main/suites` - Mocha tests that run in the main process.
  - `renderer/suites` - Mocha tests that run in the renderer process.
- `static` - HTML, CSS and other static resource files used in tests.

## Running Tests

Tests can be built and launched from the project root directory using the `npm run build:test` and
`npm test` commands respectively. To enable debugging of tests running in the main process use
`npm run test:debug`, the main process will be paused until `node-inspector` is attached to it.
